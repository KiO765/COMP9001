# COMP9001
final project src

Please notice that:
this program includes packet: pygame
and this program will call a typical windows of game for user to play
which can not work on Ed's environment and will require the tutor to run these dependencies outside of Ed.

some secret:
Actually I hope to design many jobs of the team member in the legendary Force Grey, but I really don't have that much time, and this game contain some basic information about dnd trpg, maybe someday in the future I will continue to develop all the jobs and try to change the rng method into dice pattern instead of simply random, just like my GTA baldur's gate.
